# Rollcall

A simple web extension, server, and website to chat with other people visiting the same website.

## Inspiration

It all started from a [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) post titled [Show HN: Don't let your billion-dollar ideas die](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42382506). The post links to a beautiful site called [IdeaHarbor]([i](https://ideaharbor.xyz/)). One idea was posted by user "Looyee" on December 15, 2024 that said, "A plug-in for co-browsing, allowing me to see other people on the same site/page. Where I can chat/engage with them as we share similar interest."

This is the answer to that idea. *Good idea, Looyee*!
